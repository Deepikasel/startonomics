🌏 Startonomics — Visualizing the Startup Pulse of Asia
🚀 “Empowering innovation through data, design, and storytelling.”
📖 About the Project

Startonomics is an interactive web platform that visualizes how startups across Asia are shaping innovation, employment, and economic growth.
Built by Deepika Selvaraj and Archana Gurusamy, 3rd-year B.Tech IT students at Sri Shakthi Institute of Engineering and Technology, Startonomics blends data, design, and technology to bring startup ecosystems to life.

💡 Inspiration

Every startup tells a story — of innovation, struggle, and impact.
